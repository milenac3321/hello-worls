My first repository on GitHub
I would like to share my trip back home to Cape Verde in summer of 2021. I went back after almost 10 years since moving here. Everything looked so defferent. I had the best time there, I enjoyed the food made by my grandma and aunts. I had some cachupa, a traditional cape verdean food. Ate a bunch of snacks that I remember from my childhood memneries. I would like to visit as soon as possible.
